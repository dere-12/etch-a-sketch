# Etch-A-Sketch

This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. It is a browser-based implementation of the classic Etch-A-Sketch toy, allowing users to draw on a grid by hovering over squares.

## Features

- **Customizable Grid**: Users can specify the number of squares per side (up to 100) to create a custom grid.
- **Random Colors**: Hovering over a square changes its background to a random RGB color.
- **Opacity Effect**: Repeatedly hovering over a square decreases its opacity, creating a shading effect.
- **Theme Toggle**: Users can switch between light and dark themes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styling for the grid, buttons, and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for grid creation, color changes, and user interactions.

## How to Use

1. Open the project in your browser by opening `index.html`.
2. Use the "Custom Grid" button to specify the number of squares per side for the grid.
3. Hover over the grid squares to draw with random colors.
4. Use the "Change Theme" button to toggle between light and dark themes.
